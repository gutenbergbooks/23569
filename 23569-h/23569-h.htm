<h3>By ALICE HALE BURNETT</h3>



<p>Six real stories for small boys, each complete in itself, telling about
the many interesting doings of "Toad" and "Chuck" Brown, and their
friends, "Fat," "Reddy" and others.</p>

<p>The books are written so the boy may read and understand them
and the action faithfully portrays boy life in a small town.</p>



<div class='unindent'><b>CIRCUS DAY AT MERRYVALE</b></div>

<p>"Toad" and "Reddy," by good fortune, each earn two tickets to the
circus, although they find watering elephants a harder task than it at
first seemed. A jolly party of boys visit the circus.</p>

<div class='unindent'><b>FATHER BROWN'S INDIAN TALE</b></div>

<p>Dad's story is followed by an unexpected visitor who at first startles
then interests all of the little party gathered around the fireside.</p>

<div class='unindent'><b>THE PICNIC AT MERRYVALE</b></div>

<p>Did you ever go to a picnic in a large farm wagon, filled with boys
and girls? Then did you catch a fine lot of trout and broil them before
a camp-fire? "Toad" and "Reddy" did these very things and had a
day long to be remembered.</p>

<div class='unindent'><b>CHRISTMAS HOLIDAYS IN MERRYVALE</b></div>

<p>Daddy Williams' Toy Shop is the center of interest to "Toad" and
his friends long before Christmas arrives. They plan a surprise that
brings joy to a poor family. The boys erect snow forts and the two
sides have a battle royal.</p>

<div class='unindent'><b>MERRYVALE BOYS ON THE FARM</b></div>

<p>"Toad's" grandmother invites him and "Reddy" to spend a month
in the country. Their experiences at Sunnyside farm, with its horses,
cows, pigs and chickens, are most entertainingly told, and they have the
time of their lives boating, swimming and fishing in the creek.</p>

<div class='unindent'><b>HALLOWE'EN AT MERRYVALE</b></div>

<p>For many days the boys had been looking forward to the party to
be held at Toad Brown's house, but the evening finally arrived and a
number of new games were played, although a few things happened
which were not on the program.</p>

<h2>CHRISTMAS HOLIDAYS<br />
AT MERRYVALE</h2>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<h3>TOAD'S WISH</h3>


<p>"Hurrah!" shouted "Reddy." "School
is out and no more lessons for two
weeks!" and he threw his cap into the air.</p>

<p>"Let's go home by the way of the village,
so we can look into Daddy Williams'
toy shop," suggested his friend
Thomas Brown, better known as
"Toad," who ran up to join him.</p>

<p>"All right," agreed Reddy, "and I'll
show you what I want for Christmas,"
and they started down the street.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>"Looks as though it might snow by
night," said Toad, "don't you wish there
would be a big one? Then we could get
all the boys together and have a battle."</p>

<p>"It's the best fun I know of, next to
swimming in the creek," was the answer.</p>

<p>"Here we are," he cried a few minutes
later and both boys stopped in front of a
small shop window that looked very gay
with a wonderful display of Christmas
toys.</p>

<p>"See those skates hanging up by that
sled. That's the kind I want," pointed
out Reddy. "You screw them right into
the heels of your shoes and you bet they
can't ever come off."</p>

<p>"They're fine," agreed Toad, "but
look at that engine and train. It goes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
right through the tunnel and up over the
bridge. I wonder how fast it can run."</p>

<p>"That's a dandy mitt there," said the
other, pointing to a baseball outfit. "I
wouldn't be afraid to stop any kind of a
ball with that on."</p>

<p>"Wish my dad would get me a new
sled like that flyer," sighed Toad. "I
finished mine last winter when I ran into
that tree with you and Herbie on board."</p>

<p>"You surely did," was the laughing
answer. "I remember how we all went
flying head first into a snow drift."</p>

<p>"There's a nice pocket knife," was
Toad's next remark. "I mean the one
with the pearl handle, just next to that
doll with the pink dress on."</p>

<p>"Oh!" exclaimed Reddy, "here's what<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
just suits me," catching sight, for the
first time, of a punching bag.</p>

<p>"How do you work it?"</p>

<p>"Why, you see there's an elastic rope
on each end of it, and one of them you
tie to a ring in the floor and the other to
something overhead. Then when you
give it a punch it comes back to you with
a bang."</p>

<p>"Well, I'd rather have a football;
then maybe we could get up a regular
team," remarked Toad.</p>

<p>"I'll bet all those reals would cost
about ten dollars," ventured the other,
pointing to a box of marbles toward the
front of the window. "If I was rich I'd
buy them."</p>

<p>"What for? You have plenty. You<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
won nearly all mine away from me.
Look!" he added in a low voice, "there
goes Herbie's mother into the store.
Let's see what she buys."</p>

<p>"Hello, Daddy," greeted both the
boys, as old Mr. Williams, with his
white hair, red cheeks and dancing blue
eyes, came to the doorway of the shop
and smiled at them.</p>

<p>"Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas!"
he replied. "Have you been good boys?"</p>

<p>"I should say we have," cried Toad.
"Everybody's good before Christmas."</p>

<p>"Well, run along home then, and I'll
tell your mas just what you want,"
promised Daddy. "Herbie's ma's in
here now and she doesn't want you boys
to know what she buys."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>"All right," answered Reddy. "Don't
forget to say I want a punching bag and
a pair of skates."</p>

<p>"And I want a new sled," chimed in
Toad, as they both started off.</p>

<p>"Shucks, I didn't see half the things,
did you?" protested Reddy.</p>

<p>"Oh, well, we can come down again
this afternoon," was the cheering answer.
"Come on over to my house, anyway,"
he called as they parted.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h3>THE SNOW FIGHT</h3>


<p>By evening the snow that Toad and
Reddy had so eagerly awaited had come,
and by morning many inches had fallen.
A crowd of boys had gathered on the
Brown's lawn, for the news of a snow
battle had carried far.</p>

<p>"First chooser!" cried Charley Brown,
a happy-faced boy who bore the name of
"Chuck" among his friends.</p>

<p>"Second," shouted Reddy, and when
the sides were chosen Toad found him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>self
with Herbie, a boy with whom he
played very often, and four others on
Reddy's side.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 274px;">
<img src="images/col02.jpg" width="274" height="400" alt="&quot;Charge!&quot; shouted Reddy, on the run, the others close upon his heels." title="&quot;Charge!&quot; shouted Reddy, on the run, the others close upon his heels." />
<span class="caption">&quot;Charge!&quot; shouted Reddy, on the run, the others close upon his heels.</span>
</div>

<p>It was then decided by the choosers,
who were also the captains, to build two
forts, ten yards apart, and a half hour
was agreed upon as time enough in
which to do the work.</p>

<p>"We must hurry," Reddy told the
boys he had chosen, "and I think," he
added in a low voice, "three of us had
better build the fort while the other three
make snowballs, as we want a lot on
hand so we wont have to stop firing to
make them.</p>

<p>"Work fast," he ordered as he selected
two of them to help him build the fort.</p>

<p>Toad piled up great heaps of snow<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
while Reddy and Herbie packed it down
with wooden spades into a wall which
curved like a new moon.</p>

<p>"How are the snowballs getting on,
boys?" asked Toad of the three boys
who were working hard making them.</p>

<p>"We're stacking them up so they'll be
easy to get at," answered one.</p>

<p>"They're good hard ones," said another.
"It's fine packing snow."</p>

<p>"We're going to have plenty, too,"
laughed the third.</p>

<p>"Wonder what Fat's doing?" cried
Reddy. "He's bringing a pail of water
from the house."</p>

<p>Frank, called "Fat" by the other boys,
because of his size, was Reddy's older
brother.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>"I wonder," mused Toad. "He's pouring
it on the walls of their fort. Oh,
don't you see," he added a moment later,
"it's to make it freeze."</p>

<p>"Let's do that too," proposed Herbie.
"I'll get the water," and he started for
the house.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later the walls of the fort
were like a solid mass of ice, and the
snowballs were inside in four heaps so
all were anxious for the fun to begin.</p>




<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<h3>THE VICTORY</h3>


<p>"Hey, Captain of the enemy!" shouted
Chuck from the other fort, "are you
ready?"</p>

<p>"All ready," came the answer. "Fire!"</p>

<p>A storm of snowballs flew through the
air and Reddy barely had time to duck
his head as they whizzed by.</p>

<p>"Looks as though they had plenty of
balls, too," exclaimed Toad, hastily
picking up an armful and running outside
to get within closer range.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't think so," protested Herbie.
"I could see all of them working on the
fort. We have lots more, I'm sure."</p>

<p>"Well," cried the Captain, "let everybody
take a pile of snowballs and we'll
run out together and maybe we can drive
them from their fort."</p>

<p>Each boy carried as many as he could
in one arm, this leaving the other one
free to throw with.</p>

<p>"We'll have to make a quick run for it
and throw just as fast and hard as we
can," said Herbie, as Toad, who had at
that moment returned to the fort in a
great hurry, his hat covered with snow,
exclaimed:</p>

<p>"They got me, but I hit two or three
of them!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>"All ready!" shouted the Captain, and
the others, following close on his heels,
dashed out.</p>

<p>Such a hail of snowballs met them
that they halted for a moment, then
dashed onward right up to the enemy's
fort.</p>

<p>"Don't waste any ammunition until
you get close," ordered Reddy, and his
company obeyed. "Now let her fly," he
directed, as they surrounded the fort.</p>

<p>The boys threw with a will and were
vigorously answered by the defenders of
the fort, and for a time it was hard to
see which side would win. Finally, after
the ammunition of the attacking force
was used up, Captain Reddy ordered a
retreat back to their own fort.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>"I have a better plan this time," he
announced after they were safely inside.
"When we charge again, two of you fellows
must keep running back to our own
fort so as to bring us supplies of snowballs.
Then we can keep up a much
longer fight and when anyone gets tired
throwing," he added, "he can change
places with one of the fellows that have
been carrying the balls."</p>

<p>At this moment, Herbie, who had been
on the lookout, suddenly cried:</p>

<p>"They're coming to charge us."</p>

<p>"Get ready to give it to them," ordered
the Captain and each boy, snatching
up an armful of snowballs, prepared
to repel the attack.</p>

<p>"Fire!" Reddy shouted, as the enemy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
drew near, and when they met that rain
of balls it didn't take them long to get
back to the cover of their own fort.</p>

<p>"That was great!" cried Herbie.
"Come on, let us charge this time before
they have a chance to get ready for us."</p>

<p>"Hey, I'm the Captain," insisted
Reddy. "Nobody gives any orders but
me," and he pulled his woolen cap well
down over his ears in preparation for the
coming attack.</p>

<p>"Well, hurry up and give them, then!"
shouted Toad. "I'm all loaded up."</p>

<p>"Charge, charge on!" shouted Reddy,
starting out on the run with the others
close upon his heels, and after a few
minutes of hard fighting they had forced
their way to the walls of the fort.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>The balls were flying so thick and so
fast, from both sides, that it looked like
a snow storm of enormous flakes shooting
in all directions.</p>

<p>The boys carrying balls to supply the
invaders were kept busy, but before long
it was noticed that there were fewer coming
from inside the fort.</p>

<p>"They've used up all they have,"
shouted Toad. "Let's get closer."</p>

<p>"Close in," cried Captain Reddy, "and
aim well!"</p>

<p>In another minute you could plainly
tell that each of the enemy, after throwing
one snowball, had to stop long
enough to make another one and this
was the time for which Captain Reddy
had been waiting.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>"Charge the walls!" he ordered, and
with wild cries the boys dashed forward.</p>

<p>Up over the walls they went and once
inside the victory was easily won for the
boys inside the fort were empty handed
and couldn't defend themselves.</p>

<p>"We win, we win!" exclaimed Toad,
throwing his hat into the air. "Three
cheers for Captain Reddy!"</p>

<p>"Hurrah!" shouted all the boys.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h3>CHUCK'S RUDE AWAKENING</h3>


<p>The day before Christmas dawned
bright and cold. Mother Brown, who
had been up early, made some wonderful
Christmas pies and a pudding before
Toad and Chuck were awake.</p>

<p>It was eight o'clock before Toad
opened one eye.</p>

<p>"What's the use of getting up," he
thought, "I'm so warm and comfortable
here in bed. My, but something smells
awfully good. Wonder if it's breakfast."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>Suddenly he sat up straight in bed.</p>

<p>"Look at that lazy thing," he declared.
"Bet he'd sleep until noon if I'd let him,
and with all we have to do to-day."</p>

<p>Chuck continued to snore peacefully.</p>

<p>"But I won't&mdash;I'll have some fun,"
thought Toad, as quietly, with as little
noise as possible, he crept from his bed
to the basin in one corner of the room.
It took him only a few seconds to wet a
large sponge with cold water, then,
creeping very carefully back to the foot
of Chuck's bed, he took careful aim.</p>

<p>The sponge flew through the air true
to its mark and landed "kersplash" on
Chuck's tousled brown head.</p>

<p>"W-w-w-what's the matter?" spluttered
Chuck, sitting up and blinking his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
eyes. Then, as he felt the water trickling
down his cheeks and caught sight of
Toad, doubled up with laughter, he
jumped out of bed and, running across
the room, he pushed Toad flat on his
back on the bed and sat upon his chest.</p>

<p>"Let me up," pleaded Toad. "I
couldn't help it, you looked so sweet."</p>

<p>"What'll you give me if I do?"
laughed Chuck. "You've got to pay for
that smart trick before I let you up."</p>

<p>"Nothing!" gasped Toad, trying very
hard to free himself.</p>

<p>"Oho!" laughed Chuck. "You won't,
eh? Well," he added, "I don't mind
sitting here all day. I'm real comfortable."</p>

<p>At this moment there came a knock at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
the door and before either of the boys
could answer Father Brown entered.</p>

<p>"What's up?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"Toad hit me in the face with a wet
sponge while I was asleep," explained
Chuck, "and he's going to give me something
for it."</p>

<p>"Then why are you sitting on him?"
asked Father.</p>

<p>"Because he says he won't," replied
Chuck with a grin.</p>

<p>"I suppose you'll have to pay up
Thomas," laughed Father. "Anyway,
I hope you'll both be down to breakfast
soon," he added&mdash;"before all the cakes
are gone. I've a terrible appetite this
morning," and with these words he left
the room.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do you give up now?" asked Chuck.</p>

<p>"No, sir," persisted Toad.</p>

<p>"Remember what he said about the
cakes. They'll be hot ones with lots of
maple syrup," teased Chuck.</p>

<p>"Well, you're missing them, too," retorted
Toad.</p>

<p>"I guess I'll let you off this time," relented
Chuck, "but if you ever do it
again," he threatened, "I'll hold you
down for a week, cakes or no cakes."</p>

<p>"You'd starve to death in that time,"
argued Toad, with a laugh as he commenced
to hurry into his clothing.</p>

<p>The boys were seated at the table, a
half hour later, and had just eaten the
last of the griddle cakes, when Reddy's
whistle was heard. Toad, jumping up<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
from the table, ran over to the window
and beckoned to Reddy to come into the
house.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do this morning?"
was Reddy's first remark as he entered
the room.</p>

<p>"We're going for Christmas greens
and Dad's going to cut our tree from
away up on the hillside," Toad told him,
"and," he added, "we're going to take
one of the horses with us to drag it
home."</p>

<p>"Oh, that's great!" replied Reddy.
"Do you start soon?"</p>

<p>"Don't you want to go, too?" asked
Chuck. "And maybe we can get Fat and
Herbie, too," he added.</p>

<p>"If such a crowd goes, and everybody<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
gathers greens," laughed Toad, "what
will we ever do with all of them?"</p>

<p>Mother Brown answered him from the
doorway.</p>

<p>"Why not take some of them to the
church? I'm sure the ladies who are
trimming it will be glad to use all that
you can give them."</p>

<p>"That's a splendid idea," declared
Father Brown, rising from his seat by the
fireplace. "Come, boys, bundle up well,
because it's going to be a cold drive."</p>

<p>"I'll run ahead to get the others,"
called Chuck as he hurried from the
room.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<h3>THE ADVENTURE IN THE SNOW</h3>


<p>"I'm glad we brought the sleigh,"
Father Brown remarked, as they were
driving along at a fair pace, a little later,
"as we never could have gotten through
with a wagon in this deep snow."</p>

<p>They were now starting up the hill
and the horse's feet sank deeply into the
snow drifts, although his load was not
heavy, as the boys took turns walking, so
that only two of them were riding at a
time.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>"When we reach the first clearing,"
Father proposed, "we'll cut the greens
and then leave them in a pile by the
roadside, for it is likely we shall have to
go up still higher before we can find the
tree we want."</p>

<p>After going on a few yards more he
shouted:</p>

<p>"Here's the place; all hands to work!"
and the boys started in with a will,
bringing to the roadside great heaps of
boughs and woodvines, some of them
covered with red berries and others with
grey.</p>

<p>Within a short time they had gathered
a large pile of the greens, so they
decided it was time to start out to find
the tree.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>"The tree must be full and the top
perfect," declared Father Brown, "so
keep your eyes open for it."</p>

<p>"What's the matter with that one?"
demanded Toad, pointing to a big fir
some distance away.</p>

<p>"Nothing at all the matter with it,"
laughed Chuck, "only the house is too
small to hold it."</p>

<p>"There's a nice one," called out Herbie,
pointing to the one he meant.</p>

<p>"Yes, that's a beauty," agreed Father
Brown, "and easy to get at, too."</p>

<p>After clearing away the smaller
branches near the ground, by chopping
them off with the axe, Father Brown
then started to work on the trunk of the
tree.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>"Wouldn't it be nice," suggested Fat,
"if we didn't have to cut it down at all,&mdash;just
trim it outside? It would save so
much time and trouble."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, that would be great," agreed
Reddy. "We'd just sit around on the
snow eating ice cream and look at the
tree," and he gave a hearty laugh in
which all the others joined.</p>

<p>"Well, I'll bet they do it in Greenland
and Iceland," persisted Fat, "so
why couldn't we?"</p>

<p>"Because we don't wear white Polar
bear clothes," laughed Chuck.</p>

<p>"There she comes,&mdash;she's falling!"
cried the boys.</p>

<p>"Stay where you are until it's down,"
called Father Brown to the boys.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 273px;">
<img src="images/col03.jpg" width="273" height="400" alt="&quot;There she comes! She&#39;s falling!&quot; cried the boys." title="&quot;There she comes! She&#39;s falling!&quot; cried the boys." />
<span class="caption">&quot;There she comes! She&#39;s falling!&quot; cried the boys.</span>
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>There was a sharp creak and a swish
of branches as the tree came down, and
the boys now rushed over to help tie up
the branches.</p>

<p>When that part of the work was finished,
Reddy sang out:</p>

<p>"All together! Lift her on the sled.
One, two, three!" and up it went.</p>

<p>"Nobody gets a ride home," called out
Chuck, "because the greens have to go
on top of the tree."</p>

<p>"Oh!" wailed Fat, "if I can't ride I'll
roll down. I hate to walk."</p>

<p>By the time they had reached the fields
the worst part of the trip was over.</p>

<p>"We'll cut over to the road that runs
past the church," said Father Brown,
"and leave some of the greens there,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
at which the horse was headed in that
direction.</p>

<p>As they came to the road they saw a
short distance from them an object in the
snow and as they drew nearer it proved
to be a little fellow, deep in a snow
drift. His hands were blue with the
cold and as Father Brown picked him
up in his arms he tried to speak, but
couldn't.</p>

<p>"I know who he is," volunteered Herbie.
"He's Patsy O'Reilly, and he lives
over there," pointing to a small house up
the road. "His brother Mike goes to
school with me," he continued.</p>

<p>"I'll carry him home," said Father, "as
you boys are able to handle things all
right now," saying which, he started<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
off to the little house with Patsy in his
arms.</p>

<p>Chuck, to whom Father Brown had
handed the reins now started to drive
the horse toward home.</p>

<p>When the boys arrived at the church
and had carried in the greens, the ladies
were delighted, and one of them even
tried to kiss Reddy, but he hurried away
just in time.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<h3>TOAD'S UNSELFISHNESS</h3>


<p>When they reached home Chuck
drove the sleigh up to the side door,
where the boys quickly unloaded the
greens. They then lifted the tree to the
piazza and when this had been done
Chuck drove the horse to the stable.</p>

<p>"Let's go in and get our hands warm
before we take in the greens," suggested
Toad, and soon they were all laughing
and talking before the great fire in the
library.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>Fat had just asked the others if they
remembered the day Mr. Brown had told
them about the Indians that used to live
in the woods where they found the tree,
when a man's voice was heard from the
hall.</p>

<p>"It's going to be a sad Christmas for
them, I'm afraid, for both parents are ill
and the three helpless children are waiting
for Santa Claus to come," the boys
heard Father Brown say.</p>

<p>"How sad," was Mrs. Brown's answer,
as they both went into the kitchen and
the boys could hear no more.</p>

<p>"They must be talking about the
O'Reillys," commented Fat. "Mike's a
friend of mine and I'm sorry he isn't
going to have any Christmas."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>"So am I," echoed Herbie, after a
short silence.</p>

<p>Chuck said he'd hate to awaken Christmas
morning and not find any presents.</p>

<p>"Guess I've been mighty selfish wanting
so many things," he thought.</p>

<p>Toad and Reddy, who had moved
away from the other boys, were talking
together in low, excited whispers. Then,
when the others went to the window to
look at the green outside, they slipped
from the room and hurried down the hall
to the kitchen.</p>

<p>"Mother," called Toad from the doorway,
"may we speak to you for a minute?"</p>

<p>Mother Brown handed the bowl in
which she had been stirring something to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
the cook and crossed the room toward the
boys, saying as she did so:</p>

<p>"I can only spare a few minutes to-day,
Thomas, for I am very busy."</p>

<p>"But, Mother," exclaimed Toad, "we
have a great idea!"</p>

<p>"It's a Christmas surprise party,"
chimed in Reddy, "for the O'Reillys,"
and together the two boys went on to
tell Mrs. Brown of their plans.</p>

<p>"If we could just have the horse and
sleigh to get around in," ventured Toad.
"Do you think Father would allow us to
hitch old Meg to the big sleigh?"</p>

<p>"It's a wonderful idea," agreed
Mother Brown. "Suppose you ask him.
But how about presents for the three
children? Have you thought of that?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>"If it were only after Christmas we
could give away some of our new
things," sighed Toad.</p>

<p>"But would you give them away?"
asked his mother. "Supposing you were
going to get a sled,&mdash;the kind you have
been wanting," and she paused to hear
Toad's answer.</p>

<p>He thought very hard for a moment,
then answered:</p>

<p>"Yes, because I always get a lot of
things and it might be the only present
Mike would get."</p>

<p>"Well," remarked his mother, "I have
bought you a sled, and you may give it
to him."</p>

<p>Reddy looked at Toad, as Mother
Brown turned toward the kitchen.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>"Are you sorry now that you said
'yes'?" he asked.</p>

<p>"No, I'm not," returned Toad.</p>

<p>"Well, I'll ask Mother to let me give
them something new of mine, too," declared
Reddy consolingly, putting his
arm about Toad's shoulder.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<h3>THE BOYS PLAN A SURPRISE</h3>


<p>At two o'clock the sleigh was ready,
for Father Brown had willingly given
the boys permission to use it that afternoon.
It was planned to have Chuck
drive, for Toad, Reddy, Fat and Herbie
expected to be too busy calling at the
different houses to gather the presents
which they hoped to collect for the
O'Reillys.</p>

<p>"Let's stop at Bailey's first," suggested
Fat, "as we're sure to get something
there."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>"Who'll go to the door?" questioned
Herbie.</p>

<p>"All go," answered Chuck. "That's
the best way." So in a group they rang
the bell and waited, Chuck remaining in
the sleigh.</p>

<p>No one came in answer to their ring.</p>

<p>"All out," sighed Fat; but Toad gave
the bell another pull.</p>

<p>"Bet they're all in the kitchen baking
things and didn't hear it," he remarked.</p>

<p>"There's someone coming now,"
whispered Reddy, and as the door
opened:</p>

<p>"Good afternoon," said all the boys in
chorus.</p>

<p>"Mercy upon us, where did you all
come from?" exclaimed Mrs. Bailey,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
and, as Toad held forth a card that
Father Brown had printed for them, she
asked:</p>

<p>"Am I to read this?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Mrs. Bailey, that explains
everything," Reddy told her.</p>

<p>She read:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"In one little home there may be
no Christmas cheer; the father and
mother are both ill. There are three
children; a boy of nine years, another
of five, and a girl of seven.
They need coal, clothing, food and
toys. <i>What will you give?</i>"</p></div>

<p>"So you're all playing at being Santa
Claus," remarked Mrs. Bailey with a
smile. "Well, I believe I can find something
that will please you, so just stop<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
in on your way back and I'll have it all
ready for you."</p>

<p>"Oh, thank you!" cried all the boys,
together, as they started for the sleigh,
happy over the success of their first call.</p>

<p>"Have any luck?" asked Chuck. "But
I can see you did, because you're all
grinning," he added, as they told him
what Mrs. Bailey had promised.</p>

<p>After several more visits, with the
promise of something from each place if
they would call later, Herbie proposed
that they stop at Mrs. Lee's home, as
Mary Lee had a great many dolls and
might give them one of them for the
little O'Reilly girl.</p>

<p>"That's a good idea," they all agreed,
and the idea was carried out.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>When Mrs. Lee had read the card she
asked the boys if there was anything they
needed that had not been promised.</p>

<p>"We wondered," replied Herbie, "if
Mary would give us a doll for that little
girl?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Lee smiled and said:</p>

<p>"I think I can promise you that she
will. If you will call later it will give
me a chance to get her."</p>

<p>"We'll be glad to," promised the boys,
"and thank you."</p>

<p>At five o'clock a sleigh piled high with
bundles and boys was seen turning into
the Brown's driveway.</p>

<p>"What'll we do now?" asked Toad of
the others.</p>



<p>"Let's drive into the barn and leave<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
the things in the sleigh," suggested
Chuck; "then we can meet here early tonight
and take the things to the O'Reillys."</p>

<p>"All right," assented the others.
"What time shall we meet?"</p>

<p>"At seven o'clock," said Toad.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<h3>WHAT MIKE FOUND</h3>


<p>After dinner that night Chuck and
Toad spent a little time helping to trim
the big tree that had been put in place
in the library during their absence of the
afternoon. Chuck was on the top of a
stepladder, tying shiny colored balls to
the upper branches, when Toad, who had
been busy with candy canes and popcorn
balls, suddenly stopped and looked
at the clock on the mantel.</p>

<p>"It's seven o'clock, Chuck," he cried,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
"and the others will be wondering why
we don't come out," and at this he ran
into the hall to get into his coat and cap.</p>

<p>Chuck took but a second to follow
Toad out into the yard to meet the boys.</p>

<p>Mother Brown had sent her bundle
and Toad's new sled to the barn by John,
the stableman, who put them into the
sleigh with the other things while the
boys were at dinner.</p>

<p>"Hello, boys! Everybody here?" inquired
Toad as he joined the group of
boys in front of the barn.</p>

<p>"All but Fat," laughed Reddy, "and
he'll be along in a minute. He said I
walked too fast for him."</p>

<p>"Is everything in the sleigh?" asked
Herbie, as John was hitching up.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>"Everything's in all right," Toad
assured him.</p>

<p>When about to start they found that
the sleigh was so full of bundles that
some of the boys had to stand on the runners.
Just as they reached the street, Fat
was seen coming toward them.</p>

<p>"Hurry up, lazy bones," called Reddy,
"or you'll get left," but John good-naturedly
stopped the horse until Fat
had climbed aboard.</p>

<p>There was a full moon and the sky
was bright with stars. The snow was
hard beneath the horse's feet, which
made the going easy, so they traveled
along at a brisk pace.</p>

<p>"Where shall I stop?" asked John as
they drew near the O'Reilly's cottage.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>"Just a little this side of the house,"
directed Toad, "so they won't hear us."</p>

<p>"All off, now," ordered Reddy, as John
pulled up the horse, "and help unload.
Don't let's make any more noise than we
can help."</p>

<p>"We can pile everything on the front
steps," whispered Herbie, as the boys,
each heavily laden with packages of all
sizes and shapes, walked very quietly up
the path toward the house.</p>

<p>Each carefully placed his bundles or
boxes where Herbie had suggested and
just as silently they now returned to the
sleigh.</p>

<p>"Suppose someone comes along and
takes all the things before they get up
in the morning?" argued Fat. "I don't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
think it's safe to leave them there all
night, do you?"</p>

<p>"Well, maybe we'd better throw
some snowballs at the door," proposed
Chuck, "to bring them out now."</p>

<p>This was accepted as a good plan, and
"Bang, bang, bang!" went the balls
against the door.</p>

<p>The sleigh, in which the boys took
refuge, was well hidden behind a pine
tree, so they could not be seen from the
house.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 274px;">
<img src="images/col04.jpg" width="274" height="400" alt="Framed in the doorway stood a boy gazing at a heap of bundles." title="Framed in the doorway stood a boy gazing at a heap of bundles." />
<span class="caption">Framed in the doorway stood a boy gazing at a heap of bundles.</span>
</div>

<p>"There's a light!" said Reddy in a low
voice. "Someone is opening the door."</p>

<p>"It's Mike!" answered Herbie, excitedly.
"I'll bet he can't believe his eyes."</p>

<p>It did seem to the others that what
Herbie said was true, for, framed in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
doorway of the cottage stood a boy, gazing
at a great heap of bundles and boxes
on the steps before him as if dazed.
Once he rubbed his eyes as if to make
sure he was awake, then he slowly
stretched out one hand toward the beautiful
new sled, hardly daring to believe
it was real. Then suddenly, as the boys
watched eagerly, the sled was in his arms
and he was jumping up and down with
joy, calling to those of his family who
could, to come out to see the wonderful
surprise.</p>

<p>"Time for us to be getting home now,"
whispered Chuck, and Toad, feeling
very happy, answered:</p>

<p>"I guess you're right."</p>

<p>By nine o'clock Chuck and Toad were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
sound asleep, and the stockings, tied to
the end of each bed, fell limp and empty.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<h3>CHRISTMAS MORNING</h3>


<p>"Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!"
shouted Toad.</p>

<p>It was seven o'clock and Chuck awoke
with a start and looked around him.</p>

<p>"Merry Christmas," he answered, and
both boys scrambled down to the foot of
their beds to untie the stockings full to
overflowing with candies, nuts, oranges
and many small gifts.</p>

<p>"Oh!" cried Chuck, "see what I have,"
holding his stocking up by the foot and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
shaking the contents out on the bed. "A
big knife, and a top, and some reals."</p>

<p>"So have I! By jinks, I'm glad to get
the knife,&mdash;it's a beauty, three blades!"</p>

<p>Chuck, who by this time had a whole
candy apple in his mouth, could only nod
his head in reply.</p>

<p>"Let's hurry up and dress so we can
go down to see the tree," proposed Toad.
"I'll bet there will be lots more things
for us down there," and this the boys
hastened to do.</p>

<p>"Merry Christmas," greeted Mother
Brown, a few minutes later, as the boys,
now fully dressed, came to her door.</p>

<p>"Merry Christmas, boys," called their
father from the hall below, as Mother
Brown and the boys hurried downstairs.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>As they entered the library the very
first thing that met Toad's eyes was a
beautiful new sled, much larger than the
one he had given the night before to
Michael O'Reilly.</p>

<p>"Oh, is that for me?" he cried in delight
as he pounced upon it. "I didn't
expect to get one."</p>

<p>"Yes, my son," answered his father,
"it is for you."</p>

<p>"Oh, wait until Reddy sees this!" and
Toad fairly hopped about in his delight.</p>

<p>Chuck was very much excited over a
new building game, the very thing he
had hoped for, but Toad hardly had time
to look at his other gifts from his many
aunts and uncles, so anxious was he to go
out doors to try his new sled.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>After breakfast Mother Brown helped
him into his coat and found his mittens
and cap, for they always seemed to run
away and hide while Toad slept.</p>

<p>"Come on, Chuck!" he cried. "Aren't
you coming out?"</p>

<p>"Nope, I'm going to see if I can build
a derrick," was the reply, so Toad started
off alone.</p>

<p>As he reached the hill down which most
of the boys liked best to coast, he met
Reddy, trudging along with his sled.</p>

<p>"Hey, Merry Christmas," he shouted.
"Look at what Dad gave me!"</p>

<p>"Merry Christmas," answered Reddy.
"Jingoes, that's a beauty!"</p>

<p>"Did you get the football you wanted?"
he was asked.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>"You bet I did, and a punching bag,
too."</p>

<p>"Like the one in Daddy Williams'
window?" inquired Toad.</p>

<p>"Just like it, and when you give it a
punch, whack! it comes back at you,
quick as a flash."</p>

<p>"What did Fat get?"</p>

<p>"Oh, a lot of books and a pair of ice
skates," replied Reddy, "so he's gone
over to White's pond to try them."</p>

<p>"Chuck got his building game; you
know, the one he wanted, and he wouldn't
come out," declared Toad in fine disgust.
"He's making things with it."</p>

<p>"Who's that just starting?" and Reddy
pointed up the long hill where some
one was getting ready to coast down.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
"Well, if it isn't Mike O'Reilly!" he
exclaimed,&mdash;"here ahead of us."</p>

<p>Then, as the sled with Mike lying flat
on it shot past them, they greeted him
with a shout.</p>

<p>"Hello," returned Mike, his face all
aglow with joy, "look at what I got for
Christmas."</p>

<p>"Bet you're glad now that you gave it
to him," said Reddy as the two boys
reached the top of the hill. "Let me go
down with you the first trip?"</p>

<p>"You bet!" Toad assented.</p>

<p>"Merry Christmas," Reddy shouted,
giving the sled a push from behind.
"One, two, three, we're off," and down
they flew.</p>

<p>"She's speedy, all right," he declared<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
as the cold north wind stung his cheeks.</p>

<p>"And she steers like a bird," echoed
Toad.</p>
